            Iâ€™m Ingrid<span class="point">.</span> An aeronautical engineer who
            worked with renewable energy and decided to change careers and
            become a developer<span class="point">.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years ago the company I worked for in Brazil started a movement
            to the digitalisation of processes<span class="point">.</span> It
            was when I started learning Alteryx and SQL<span class="point"
              >.</span
            >
            When I saw what those tools were capable of I started envisioning
            myself working in tech<span class="point">.</span> I knew the many
            possibilities I could have, but what I realised while using those
            tools was how interesting the challenges could be and how many
            problems I could solve with tech<span class="point">.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            About a year ago my partner, who is a web developer, moved to the
            Netherlands and since then we started thinking about me moving as
            well<span class="point">.</span> At that time he saw how much I was
            enjoying SQL and asked me if I wasn't considering moving
            careers<span class="point">.</span> He tried teaching me the basics
            of JavaScript<span class="point">.</span> It wasn't the same as SQL,
            but I noticed how much more powerful the tool was<span class="point"
              >.</span
            >
            I got excited and took a free online course<span class="point"
              >.</span
            >
            At the same time we were also solving problems together<span
              class="point"
              >.</span
            >
            It was when I started to see myself writing code to solve problems
            and creating new things<span class="point">!</span>
